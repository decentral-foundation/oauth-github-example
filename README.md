# How to use


First install dependencies `npm i`  

Then create a Github app. Navigate to developer settings. Make sure the endpoint for the callback matches what you put into your Github app.  

Then you'll populate the `.env` file with the client and secret generated by the Github app page. Run `npm start`. 

Navigate to http://localhost:3000
